# Color Palette Generator

The Color Palette Generator is a simple, easy-to-use tool designed as a replacement for [Palettable.io](https://palettable.io/), which is no longer functional. The goal of this project is to provide users with an intuitive interface for generating color palettes and to showcase the capabilities of ChatGPT 4.0 in writing code.

Anything tagged with :robot: is generated by ChatGPT. Anything tagged with :man: is a human-driven update.
